        <h2>Part C</h2>

        <h3>Comparisons between part A and part B challenges:</h3>
        <p>
            For part A, the challenges that I encountered was that I did not 
            not know how to center the elements in the middle; therefore, all
            my elements were not centered and can be seen off center when resizing the window.
            For part B, I did not have this problem as part A; therefore, I had 
            less code due to it being automatically centered. Also, since the
            elements were automatically centered. I did not know how to adjust
            the top banner to the full screen because I do not know how to 
            change the class from container to container-fluid to achieve
            that.
        </p>

        <h3>The one that is easier/better and took less time:</h3>
        <p>
            The one that took the least time was part B because 
            it was the same as using CSS, but implemented using 
            bootstrap. I also did not have to center elements; hence, 
            there would be less code, which made it easier to implement.
            I liked Bootstrap the best because I do not have to think about 
            centering elements in the screen as it automatically adjust
            margins. Also if I inplemented forms and carousel,
            it would be easier than using plain HTML and CSS.
